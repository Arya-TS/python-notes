# 🐍 Arya's Python Learning Log

Hi there! I'm Arya — a Computer Science student and aspiring Data Scientist 🌱  
This is my little digital notebook where I’m tracking what I learn as I begin my journey into Python and coding.

## ✨ Why I Started
I want to build real things, solve problems, and someday work in data science and tech.  
This is where it all begins. Even if the steps are small — I’m taking them 💖

## 📘 What You’ll Find Here
- My course notes 
- Little code snippets and beginner projects
- Reflections, wins, and maybe even some cute comments 😌

## 🧸 My Current Status
Just getting started, one `print("hello world")` at a time ✨  
Let’s grow together!
