## Hardware Overview

### Generic Computer Components

[Input & Output Devices] â†’ [[Control Processing Unit] â†” [Main Memory]] â†” [Secondary Memory]
                              
- â†’ **Control Processing Unit** is responsible for executing software instructions.
- â†’ **Main Memory** is used to temporarily store data during execution.
- â†’ **Input/Output Devices** allow user interaction.

**Primary vs Secondary Memory**  
ðŸ§  Primary Memory (Main Memory):

- Fast, small storage area (also called RAM).

- Volatile: data is lost when the system is powered off or shut down.

ðŸ§  Secondary Memory:

- Non-volatile storage (e.g., hard disks, SSDs, pen drives).

- Retains data even after shutdown.
