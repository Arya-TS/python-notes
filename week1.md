# 🧠 Week 1: Python for Everybody

## Why Programming?

Programming is a very creative and rewarding activity.  
We can write programs for many reasons—ranging from making your living, solving difficult data analysis problems, to simply having fun or helping someone else solve a problem.

## Hardware Overview

### Generic Computer Components

[Input & Output Devices] → [[Control Processing Unit] ↔ [Main Memory]] ↔ [Secondary Memory]
                              
- → **Control Processing Unit** is responsible for executing software instructions.
- → **Main Memory** is used to temporarily store data during execution.
- → **Input/Output Devices** allow user interaction.

**Primary vs Secondary Memory**
🧠 Primary Memory (Main Memory):

- Fast, small storage area (also called RAM).

- Volatile: data is lost when the system is powered off or shut down.

🧠 Secondary Memory:

- Non-volatile storage (e.g., hard disks, SSDs, pen drives).

- Retains data even after shutdown.
